# VDS Class Project - Reduced Order Binary Decision Diagram Package (ROBDD)

- mkdir build
- cd build
- Now, once you are inside the build directory, enter the following commands to compile the package:
- cmake ..
- make

## Running tests
- Once you have compiled the package you have a binary file called ./VDSProject_test
